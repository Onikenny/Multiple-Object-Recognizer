# Multiple-Object-Recognizer

A Convolutional Neural Network is adapted to recognise the 4 object types in a dataset. The performance of the model as well as the trade-off between various factors is observed from the training session. As a follow-on part, the network is tested on a new dataset of images containing the four object categories occuring in different contexts, e.g. close-up, far-away, in a busy visual context, in an isolated image, etc. This project is a probe into the performance of convolution models trained from scratch and the factors that affect their performance. As a control test, A pre-trained model is fine tuned and then tested on the same set of images.  

All data as well as the original network used are available in the repo directory.
